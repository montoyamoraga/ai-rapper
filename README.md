```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

everytime you do pip3 its going to install locally

```bash
deactivate
```

```bash
pip3 install mido
```

```bash
pip3 install rtmidi
```

since you are in a python3 environment pip and pip3 mean the same, but its good to be explicit

```bash
git merge upstream/master
```

pull from master repo

```bash
git push
```

push to cloud repo
